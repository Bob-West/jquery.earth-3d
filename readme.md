Visualization of flight routes

## Description

In this project we used flight route data to draw the routes onto the WebGL model. In the final version it is possible to select out of some airports, to visualize the routes coming from this airport.
You can further select a distinct route, to get an better impression on this airlines. We selected only a bunch of airports, some of which we think very frequent.
After switching between airports or airlines, the whole earth model has to be redrawn, because we didn't find a way to remove already drawn routes.
The whole project was built by us for a course in university on information visualization.
